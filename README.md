Started learning react 5 days ago, here's a simple project(for accommodation rental) i built within 5 days with react for frontend, django for backend + django rest framework and jwt(json web tokens for authentication) + pytesseract + deepface for ML. Pytesseract and Deepface i used them to comfirm if indeed a user owns a space they say they own, for instance under the verification page, a live picture of the user's face is captured, and the user must also upload a picture of their id card and also a picture of their proof of the residence, the live picture of their face gets compared to the face picture on their id , if they match, we extract id number and names from the id picture and also id number and names from the proof of residence and compare them, if they match the the user gets given landlord previleges. But we still have to train a model to determine if an id picture uploaded is a real id and the proof of residence is also real, data is the problem here.
